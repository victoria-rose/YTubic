/**
 * LRCLIB (https://lrclib.net) — free, open lyrics database with synced
 * LRC-format lyrics.
 *
 * Tauri's HTTP plugin is required, same as Musixmatch and Genius. LRCLIB
 * itself does send permissive CORS headers, so a webview `fetch()` looks
 * like it should work, and it does in `tauri dev`, which is exactly why
 * this shipped broken. CORS is not the binding constraint: our own
 * `app.security.csp` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` declares an explicit
 * `connect-src` listing only `'self'` and localhost. Tauri injects that CSP
 * when serving `build.frontendDist` and never against `build.devUrl`, so a
 * plain `fetch("https://lrclib.net/...")` succeeds in dev and is blocked in
 * every packaged build, silently taking out the only duration-aware
 * provider and leaving the weaker sources to answer alone.
 *
 * Going through `tauriFetch` sidesteps the CSP (the request is made by Rust,
 * not the webview) and lets us send `Lrclib-Client`, which LRCLIB asks
 * third-party clients for and which the webview forbids from JS.
 * `lrclib.net` must therefore be in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`:
 * `tauri-plugin-http` rejects unlisted hosts at the Rust boundary before any
 * network call. `hosts.test.ts` guards both halves of that.
