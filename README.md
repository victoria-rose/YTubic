Built as a reaction to the sluggish webview-wrapper experience — YTubic talks to YouTube's InnerTube API directly, renders its own UI, and caches aggressively, so navigation and playback feel instant.

## Features

- **Fast and responsive UI** — instant navigation with prefetch and aggressive caching; no page reloads, no spinners on every click
- **Flexible player layouts** — dock the player at the bottom or as a right-side panel
- **Floating player widget** — pop the player out into a compact always-on-top window
- **Synced lyrics** — line-by-line synced lyrics from multiple providers (LRCLIB, Musixmatch, Genius)
- **Hi-res cover art** — upgrades album covers to high-resolution studio art when available
- **Full library support** — your playlists, likes, albums and artists; search with filters; radio/autoplay queues
- **Windows integration** — media keys, System Media Transport Controls, tray icon, single instance
- **Auto-updates** — the app updates itself from GitHub Releases, and keeps its yt-dlp copy fresh automatically

## Install

YTubic is released in two separate editions on the [Releases](../../releases) page:

*   **Premium Patched Edition (Tag: `v*-patched`)**: Bypasses the YouTube Music Premium paywall checks locally, letting you stream high-quality audio and play tracks even if your Google account does not have an active Music Premium subscription.
*   **Cookie Patched Edition (Tag: `v*-cookie-patched`)**: A clean, authentic build that does not bypass the paywall. It includes our robust cookie domain matching and session import fixes to prevent random logouts for users who already have an active YouTube Music Premium subscription.

### Requirements & Setup
*   **Windows 10/11 only** for now.
*   On first launch, the app downloads its own copy of yt-dlp (~12 MB) into its data folder and keeps it updated automatically.
*   Signing in is optional: browsing works anonymously; sign in (or import cookies under **Settings** → **Account**) to unlock your library, likes, and playlists.

### FAQ

**Windows says "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen).**
The installer is not code-signed (certificates are expensive for a free
open-source project). Click "More info" → "Run anyway". The source code is
public — you can audit it or build it yourself.

**My antivirus flags the app / yt-dlp.**
yt-dlp is a widely-used open-source downloader that some AV vendors
false-positive on. The binary is downloaded directly from yt-dlp's official
GitHub releases.

**Will Google ban my account for using this?**
Browsing/search/library requests look identical to the official web app, and
audio streaming is fully anonymous (never tied to your account). There are no
known cases of accounts being banned for third-party players — but no
guarantees; see the disclaimer above.

**Playback suddenly stopped working.**
YouTube periodically changes its streaming internals. yt-dlp usually ships a
fix within days, and the app picks it up automatically (it self-updates its
yt-dlp copy every ~3 days). Restarting the app forces the check.

## Stack

- **Shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust backend, system webview — WebView2 on Windows)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build:** Vite 7
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (new-york style, neutral base, YouTube red accent)
- **Routing:** TanStack Router (file-based, type-safe, prefetch on intent)
- **Data:** TanStack Query
- **Client state:** Zustand
- **Icons:** lucide-react

## Dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Frontend-only dev (no Tauri window): `pnpm dev`.

## Production Build

To build the native desktop application (production installer):

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The resulting `.exe` installer will be generated in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

## Quality checks

```bash
pnpm test         # vitest unit tests (pure parsers/matchers)
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm format       # prettier --write
pnpm build        # tsc + vite production frontend build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, lint, tests, build and
`cargo check` on every push / PR.
